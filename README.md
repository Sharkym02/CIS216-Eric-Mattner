# CIS216-Eric-Mattner

I am taking CIS 216 to keep my fundamentals strong and learn the ins and outs of object-oriented programming since most of my coding experience has been in functional programming. I have prior experience in C, C++, assembly, and Java. I hope to become proficient in python and learn coding standards and practices that will help me in the workplace. I chose python as my programming language because I have never used it extensively, and I believe it is beneficial to code effectively in as many languages as possible.
