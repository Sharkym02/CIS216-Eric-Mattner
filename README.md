# CIS216-Eric-Mattner

I am taking CIS 216 to keep my fundamentals strong and learn the ins and outs of object-oriented programming since most of my coding experience has been in functional programming. I have prior experience in C, C++, assembly, and Java. I hope to become proficient in python and learn coding standards and practices that will help me in the workplace. I chose python as my programming language because I have never used it extensively, and I believe it is beneficial to code effectively in as many languages as possible.

Assignment 1: Refreshed on the basics of python programming

Assignment 2: I learned how classes and methods are created and utilized in python, and compartmentalized the BMI program. These techniques will be commonly used in the future to make code easier to follow for both myself and others who look at it.

Assignment 3: I learned about properties, how to create them, and how I can utilize them to improve my code. I also learned about read-only attribute conventions and how to build robust constructors. In the future, I can use this knowledge to ensure that I don't modify internal variables that break my programs. I can also use properties to alter my classes and not have to edit my programs that use them.

Assignment 4: I learned effective techniques about how to validate my values, and ensure that methods receive proper types and ranges for its arguments. I will use these techniques to make my future programs resilient to bugs and user error.

Assignment 5: I created units test for each function in my BMI class, and learned effective ways of using unit tests to debug my code. 

Assignment 6: I learned how to create subclasses, and how to incorporate their relations and their inheritance of the traits of their parent classes to create effective programs. Using subclasses well and ensuring that they can properly utilize all properties of the parent class will be essential to nearly every program I write in the future

Assignment 7: I learned how to effectively use polymorphism to make my subclasses work better alongside each other, making them more effective and easier to read. I will use this in the future to make sure my subclasses do their specialized tasks successfully.

Assignment 8: I created GUI's for a simple hello world program, and a simple text editor that allows the user to type and contains two scollbars, one vertical and one horizontal. This will be very useful in the future, since most programs with user input have a GUI rather than directly utilizing the command line. 

Assignment 9: I edited the text editor such that it contains a file menu and edit menu, which allows the user to open a new text or close the current one, and allows the user to cut, copy, and paste the text in the editor. I will use the tools I learned in this assignment in the future in most, if not all GUI's I develop in the future, since nearly every GUI involves menus that the user frequently interacts with. 

Assignment 10: I added more file options, including open and save functions, to the text editor, as well as a text color menu. The ability to open save dialogues and knowing how to make programs interact with other files on your computer is extremely important to having robust programs, and improves ease of use for users. The addition of the text color menu taught me a lot about hex codes, and how to manipulate results from certain functions to a specific type you want.
