# CIS216-Eric-Mattner

I am taking CIS 216 to keep my fundamentals strong and learn the ins and outs of object-oriented programming since most of my coding experience has been in functional programming. I have prior experience in C, C++, assembly, and Java. I hope to become proficient in python and learn coding standards and practices that will help me in the workplace. I chose python as my programming language because I have never used it extensively, and I believe it is beneficial to code effectively in as many languages as possible.

Assignment 1: Refreshed on the basics of python programming

Assignment 2: I learned how classes and methods are created and utilized in python, and compartmentalized the BMI program. These techniques will be commonly used in the future to make code easier to follow for both myself and others who look at it.

Assignment 3: I learned about properties, how to create them, and how I can utilize them to improve my code. I also learned about read-only attribute conventions and how to build robust constructors. In the future, I can use this knowledge to ensure that I don't modify internal variables that break my programs. I can also use properties to alter my classes and not have to edit my programs that use them.

Assignment 4: I learned effective techniques about how to validate my values, and ensure that methods receive proper types and ranges for its arguments. I will use these techniques to make my future programs resilient to bugs and user error.

Assignment 5: I created units test for each function in my BMI class, and learned effective ways of using unit tests to debug my code. 

Assignment 6: I learned how to create subclasses, and how to incorporate their relations and their inheritance of the traits of their parent classes to create effective programs. Using subclasses well and ensuring that they can properly utilize all properties of the parent class will be essential to nearly every program I write in the future
